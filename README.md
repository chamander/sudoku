# Sudoku

This is a little Sudoku player I made that can load in text files to play Sudoku games.

Sudoku input files are plain text files with the extension (.sud). They must consist of 81 numbers between 0 to 9 inclusive, each separated by whitespace. The number 0 is a special number that represents an empty space on the grid.

Current plan of things that I can add:
* Use the numpad to enter in numbers
* Have a set of input buttons on the right of the GUI that can also be used to input numbers
* Automatic checking for when the grid is solved and a way to notify the user
* Automatic solver
* Highlighting the selected row, column and 3x3 box of the selected cell
* Automatic detection when an invalid number is placed
* Options that allow these features to be toggled
* (Maybe) Add support for sub numbers
* (Maybe) Extra options that can change the font or colors that are used
* (Maybe) Auto resizing support
* (Maybe) Make it prettier
* (Maybe) Autogenerate levels
